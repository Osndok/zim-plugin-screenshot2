This is basically the stock screenshot plugin with the following modifications:
* there is no modal options dialog box (it will always use bounds/rectangular selection over whole-window or whole-screen)
* it can be activated with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-U)
* it can be activated by clicking a toolbar button
* the files it creates will be named differently:
** with the page path rather than a static 'screenshot*' prefix
*** e.g. snapping a screenshot into the ":Bob:Jones" page will yield a file named "Bob-Jones-{DATE}-{TIME}.png"
** with the hexadecimal unix time rather than the much longer calendar/decimal time
*** e.g. "test-20161002-103540.png" becomes "test-57F1294C.png"

Todo:
* configuration option to automatically minimize Zim when the screenshot request is activated (and maybe to reappear after the screenshot is acquired) as this would help those with small screens
