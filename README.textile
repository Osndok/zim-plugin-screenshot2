This is basically the stock screenshot plugin with the following modifications:
* there is no modal options dialog box (it will always use bounds/rectangular selection over whole-window or whole-screen)
* it can be activated with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-U)
* it can be activated by clicking a toolbar button
* the files it creates will be named with the page path rather than a static 'screenshot*' prefix
** e.g. snapping a screenshot into the ":Bob:Jones" page will yield a file named "Bob-Jones-{DATE}-{TIME}.png"
